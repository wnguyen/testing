foo(1) -- solves world hunger
=============================

## SYNOPSIS

`foo` [-asdf] _FILE_

## DESCRIPTION

This is a man page written in markdown. I hope this works.

It appears to be working.

## OPTIONS

* `-a`:
    All mode. Solve all of the world's problems, not just hunger.

* `-s`:
    Silent mode. Don't make a big fuss about it.

* `-d`:
    Dumb mode. Help the rich and poor equally.

* `-f`:
    Fresh mode. Only help those that haven't been helped before.

## HISTORY

Regular man pages (i.e. groff files) didn't seem to work on GitHub, despite
their claims to support it. Darn.
