foo(1) -- solves world hunger
=============================

## SYNOPSIS

`foo` [-asdf] <FILE>

## DESCRIPTION

This is a man page written in markdown. I hope this works.

## OPTIONS

`-a` all
`-s` some
`-d` dumb
`-f` fresh

## HISTORY

Regular man pages (i.e. groff files) didn't seem to work on GitHub, despite
their claims to support it. Darn.
